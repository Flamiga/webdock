          into your bones. Christian Windfeld throws his hands over the greenish bronze waterbowl as if he has never done anything else, it’s fascinating to see how the waters move like soundwave. </b>

It seems quite natural to see a bow of a violin playing on the drum, with other components placed between his legs, even though they
            are contrasts in the world of music. It’s barely the music we’re used to hear in the radio or when the symphony orchestra is playing but more like noises from a highway. But even when Christian Windfeld stretches the bow over the edge of the
            drum, a beautiful sound from the bow fills out the noise.</b>
